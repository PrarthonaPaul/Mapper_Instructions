  <p class="w3-center"><em>ECE297 MAPPING SOFTWARE</em></p>
  <p>
    This is a mapping software that maps out different cities based on the user's request. It displays different types of roads
    including motorways and trunkways, primary, secondary and tertiaty roads. The map also diaplays various features within the 
    city, such as golfcourses, parks, lakes, streams etc; and points of interests, such as restaurents, coffee shops, banks, etc.
    The user can also query the map to search for intersections, streets and look for their Information. 
  </p>

  </h3>
<button type="button" class="Collapsible"> <b>Feature 1:</b> Loading maps for different cities</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The software has a drop down menu where you can select different cities and open their maps. To change cities, please click the dropdown 
      menu and select the desired city. This will load the map for the appropriate city without the user having to change the source code or 
      recompile the program. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <br>

  <button type="button" class="Collapsible"> <b>Feature 2:</b> Selecting desired Points of interests</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The map also has a drop down for the points of interests in the city. The user can select a particular type of point of interest, for
       example, schools, cafe or hospitals. The user can look for POI's of that specific type in their zoomed in area. For usability, the user must 
       zoom in at least 5 times, or for larger cities, like Tokyo, 10 times to be able to search for points of interests. 
       If the user is not happy with the results and want to zoom out to see another area, they can repeat the same steps for another area. 
       Once they have found the desired results, the user can zoom in and out and pan the map to explore each options.

  <button type="button" class="Collapsible"> <b>Feature 3: </b> Dark mode</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The map utilizes a dark mode feature where the user can switch to dark mode which uses a darker background and high contrast colours to 
      help with visibility in the dark as well as at night time. All colours for streets, featurs and texts change accordingly when the user 
      switches between the modes.

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Each city displays all the subway routes when the subway button is clicked. The different lines are differentiated using their assigned 
      colours as seen on the city's actual subway map. When the subway map is turned on, if the user clicks on a subway station, the software 
      displays the name of the subway station.

    <ol>
      <li>
        The program has the ability to show major and minor streets, as well as the highways. They are all categirized as
        motorways, trunks, primary, secondary and tertiary streets. As you zoom in, more streets will be shown and more 
        details, such as the name, and the direction of one way streets will show up.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        If you want to switch to another city's map, please locate the drop down menu on the top right corner and select 
        one of the cities from the list. Once the map is loaded, you can zoom in, pan and look around the map at different 
        zoom levels. 
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        If you are looking for certain points of interests, such as, library, schools, cafe, bar or reatsurents, the software can 
        locate icons on on the map and display the locations of these poi's. They are also categorized, so, if you wanted to 
        look for only cafes or restaurents, then you can pick the type from the 2nd drop down menu. 
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        To help with usability, you will need to zoom in at least 5 times, or for larger cities like Tokyo, zoom in at least 
        10 times before being able to look for the POI's. This way, we are not overwhelming you with too many options at once. 
        If you are not happy with the results, you can zoom out and the results will still be there and you can querry a 
        different area for the POI. 
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        If you click on a particular points on the map, the software will also tell you what the closest intersection is. For 
        better usability, we have made it so that you need to zoom in to be able to quary this feature. If you are not on the 
        correct zoom level, the software will show an error message asking you to zoom in further. If you no longer want to 
        see the selected intersection, please click on the reset button and it will clear all the intersections for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        The software also has a dark mode, which uses high contrast colours with dark mode. This is perfect for when you are 
        using this software at night and want to avoid bright lights. Simply click the dark mode button to switch between the 
        modes and enjoy! 
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        If you want to see the subway stations of each of the cities, simply click on the subway button and it will show you 
        all the subway routes and stations in the city, with the stations marked in circles and connected by lines along the 
        path. If you click on the subway stations, the prohram will display the name of the subway station at the bottom 
        of the screen.

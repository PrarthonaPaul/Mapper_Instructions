  <p class="w3-center"><em>ECE297 MAPPING SOFTWARE</em></p>
  <p>
    This is a mapping software that maps out different cities based on the user's request. It displays different types of roads
    including motorways and trunkways, primary, secondary and tertiaty roads. The map also diaplays various features within the 
    city, such as golfcourses, parks, lakes, streams etc; and points of interests, such as restaurents, coffee shops, banks, etc.
    The user can also query the map to search for intersections, streets and look for their Information. 
  </p>

  <p class="w3-large w3-center w3-padding-16">Key features of the software:</p>
  <button type="button" class="Collapsible"> Feature 1: Loading maps for different cities</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The software has a drop down menu where you can select different cities and open their maps. To change cities, please click the dropdown 
      menu and select the desired city. This will load the map for the appropriate city without the user having to change the source code or 
      recompile the program. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <br>

  <button type="button" class="Collapsible"> Feature 2: Selecting desired Points of interests</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The map also has a drop down for the points of interests in the city. The user can select a particular type of point of interest, for
       example, schools, cafe or hospitals. The user can look for POI's of that specific type in their zoomed in area. For usability, the user must 
       zoom in at least 5 times, or for larger cities, like Tokyo, 10 times to be able to search for points of interests. 
       If the user is not happy with the results and want to zoom out to see another area, they can repeat the same steps for another area. 
       Once they have found the desired results, the user can zoom in and out and pan the map to explore each options.
    </p>

  <button type="button" class="Collapsible"> Feature 3: Dark mode</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The map utilizes a dark mode feature where the user can switch to dark mode which uses a darker background and high contrast colours to 
      help with visibility in the dark as well as at night time. All colours for streets, featurs and texts change accordingly when the user 
      switches between the modes. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="Collapsible"> Feature 4: Subways</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Each city displays all the subway routes when the subway button is clicked. The different lines are differentiated using their assigned 
      colours as seen on the city's actual subway map. When the subway map is turned on, if the user clicks on a subway station, the software 
      displays the name of the subway station.

  <button type="button" class="Collapsible"> Feature 5: Finding intersections</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The user is able to enter names of two streets into the search bar and find the intersection between the two streets. 
      If there is no intersection found, then the program displays that.
